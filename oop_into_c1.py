# Everythin in python are basically objects.

x = 5
y = 'string'

print(type(x))
print(type(y))

#x is the instance of the 'int' class whose value is 5 whereas y is the instance of the 'str' class where its value is 'string'.

y.strip()

#stip is a method on class str.

#methods are functions that are defined for a specific class and are called with "." (dot)
