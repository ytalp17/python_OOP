# python_OOP

This repo is created following the Python Classes & Objects Tutorial by Tech With Tim on Youtube.
Lazy ones can use as source code while following the video series. I also supplement the Python codes with comments in line with the series' content.

Index:
c1 - Intro
c2 - Python Classes
c3 - Class Inheritance
c4 - Overriding Methods
c5 - Static Methods & Class Methods
c6 - Public & Private Methods



PS: The video series is strongly recommended for those who are new to Object Oriented Programming on Python!



Keep coding!
